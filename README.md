# Animation-CSS

Hi, KY here.

This topic is about simple animations. Animation is a technique for creating visual effects by continuously playing a still image or drawn figure. In this theme, some simple animations are shown, which may include the motion of basic shapes, the transformation of objects or the gradual change of images, among others. These simple animations can be used to increase the appeal of a web page, application, or presentation, bringing a more vivid and interesting experience to the user.

Hope that caught your attention.(*￣︶￣)
